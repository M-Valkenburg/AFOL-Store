## General Information
This project was created for the Frond-End career path from CodeCademy.

For the final project the assignment is to create an application with React-Redux either with some suggested API's, some suggestions which require an additional course or something of your own choice. 
I decided to go with the latter and create a web shop because I thought it provides a good challenge.
